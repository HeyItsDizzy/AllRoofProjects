H3 tags are secondary subheadings used to provide
additional structure and hierarchy to web content. They act as
subordinate headings to H2 tags and are crucial for finely
dividing the content into clearer sections. These tags make it
easier for both users and search engines to navigate and
understand the content on deeper levels, resulting in a more
organized page.
H3 tags play an important role in SEO by improving the page's
content structure. By including relevant keywords in these
subheadings, the website can clarify specific parts of the
content for search engines, which facilitates better ranking in
search results. This improved structure also makes it easier
for visitors to find and focus on specific parts of the page,
which can lead to longer visit times and higher engagement.
