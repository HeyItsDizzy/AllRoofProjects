The H2 tag, often known as the subtitle or secondary heading,
is an important element in web design and SEO. These tags
are used to structure and organize the content on a webpage
in a logical and easily understandable hierarchy. H2 tags
provide an overview of the page's content and are key to
making the page more accessible and comprehensible for
both users and search engines.
H2 tags are crucial for improving a website's SEO. By clearly
defining sections and subsections with H2 tags, you help
search engines understand and index your website more
effectively, which can lead to better placements in search
results. Furthermore, H2 tags contribute to a better user
experience by making the text more readable and easier to
navigate. This can lead to longer visit times and lower bounce
rates, which is positive for both the website's credibility and
its SEO ranking.
