The structural performance of the sheeting system in shear\ndiaphragms is not covered in this Standard.\n\nThe bracing behaviour should be evaluated by testing—\n(a) _ in steel frame buildings using AS/NZS 4600; or\n(b) _ in timber frame buildings using ISO 19049 or TR 440.\n\n‘As cladding is simultaneously subjected to out-of-plane and diaphragm loads, where\nbracing resistance is required from the cladding system, allowance should be made for the\ninteraction between the sheeting capacity under the two loading directions. The interaction\nmay be different for non-cyclonic wind loads and cyclonic wind loads. Where the maximum.\nshear stress due to diaphragm action does not exceed 25% of the maximum bending stress,\nit is anticipated that interaction is negligible.\n\nwww standards.org.au"
