Printed / viewed by:allrooftakeoffs @gmail.com @ 29/05/2025\n\nAS 1562.1:2018 2\n\nPREFACE\n\nThis Standard was prepared by the Standards Australia Committee BD-014, Metal\nCladding, to supersede AS 1562.1—1992,\n\nThis Standard is part of a series on sheet roof and wall cladding which comprises the\nfollowing:\n\nAS\n1562 Design and installation of sheet roof and wall cladding\n1562.1 Part 1: Metal (this Standard)\n\n1562.3 Part 3: Plastic\n\nAS/NZS\n1562 Design and installation of sheet roof and wall cladding\n1562.2 Part 2: Corrugated fibre-reinforced cement\n\nThe objective of this Standard is to provide designers and installers with clear information\nto determine the minimum requirements for the correct and safe design and installation of\nsheet metal roof and wall cladding, based on the best available evidence and current\nindustry practice.\n\nThe main technical changes to the Standard are the following:\n(a) Revision of the design section to align with current versions of AS/NZS 1170 series.\n\n(b) Revision of the installation section to provide flashing requirements to minimize the\nrisk of water ingress, and to highlight the importance of fixing ancillary equipment to\nthe roof structure rather than just the roof cladding.\n\n(c) Revision of the testing section to align it with current practice whereby roof cladding\nfor cyclonic areas must withstand a Low-Hi-Low test regime.\n\n(d) Alignment with HB 39 and relevant Australian Standards including AS/NZS 1170\nseries and AS 4040 series.\n\n(©) Clarification of the design aspects such as rainwater capacity, adjacent metal\nsuitability, and minimum fixing requirements for flashings have been clarified.\n\n(6) Incorporation of factors for variation of repeat load testing have to align with current\npractice.\n\n(g) Requirements to fix flashing of wall and roof joints and ridge capping with screw\nconnectors at a minimum spacing of either 300 mm for some flashing edges and\n600 mm for others.\n\n(h) Improved presentation of design documentation and test report for the performance\nverification of cladding systems.\n\nIn this Standard, notes are for information and guidance only. Statements expressed in\nmandatory terms in notes to tables or figures are deemed to be requirements of this\nStandard\n\nThe terms ‘normative’ and ‘informative’ have been used in this Standard to define the\napplication of the appendix to which they apply. A ‘normative’ appendix is an integral part\nof a Standard, whereas an ‘informative’ appendix is only for information and guidance."

Design and\ninstallation of cladding for stressed-skin buildings should be undertaken using relevant\nmanuals such as EN 1993-1-3. Information on evaluating bracing capacity of cladding is\ngiven in Appendix E.\n\n3. Some of the design and testing provisions in this Standard may apply to metal faced structural\ninsulated panels although some of the material specifications for these products are not\ncovered in this Standard,\n\nsensed to Intertek Inform for All Roof Take-offs,\n\nNo further reproduction or distribution permitted.
